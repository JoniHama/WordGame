# Installation
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is needed

This game only uses standard Python library so requirements.txt is not needed.

Download the code from the repository and launch a terminal. Then navigate to the folder where you have installed the code.

Once it's installed launch the WordGame.py from the terminal:

```
python WordGame.py
```
